Dear Professor Luo,

My name is Daheng Yin (尹达恒). I'm a 3rd year MSc student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Southeast University.
Being desirous of completing more interesting and meaningful work on the optimization and application of deep learning algorithms, I am interested in the Ph.D. program starting in 2023 fall at HKU, particularly the research opportunities in your group.

## My research background

My research interests lie primarily in the application-driven optimization of deep learning algorithms.

In my master's thesis, I focus on achieving high-performance neural-enhanced live video streaming applications in the edge computing environment.
In this application, the super-resolution model should be distributedly deployed on a series of low-power computing devices in the unstable network and collaboratively produce high-quality video with low latency. 

The most challenging but fascinating part of this project is the optimization of the super-resolution model based on the characteristics of the application, and I have gained a great deal from it. In particular, it prompted me to think deeply about the architecture of the super-resolution model in a practical way to make improvements to the model based on the insights of the application and model structure.

Also, this project is complex and systematic that involves the optimization, training, and deployment of deep learning algorithms as well as coding, decoding, and transmission of the video and features.
Implementation of the application also led me to become an experienced developer capable of organizing large projects.

I believe all of these experiences and skills can benefit my further research in your group.

(The related paper "WAEVSR: Enabling collaborative live video super-resolution in wide-area MEC environment" has been submitted to WWW2023.)

## My thinking about further research

Currently, the neural-enhanced live video streaming system is still bottlenecked by the performance of the model inference latency. None of the typical video super-resolution models (EDVR, TDAN, BasicVSR, etc) can achieve the desired latency in practice even with intensive optimization. To break through this bottleneck, optimization on the super-resolution model has become the primary focus of my master's thesis, and will still be the focus of further research.

Besides, I also found many interesting phenomena during the experiments. Further research may provide some novel insights for model optimization in many other applications.

## Why I believe you would be a suitable supervisor

I believe your expertise in deep learning algorithms will help me excel in this field, and my proposed research also aligns well with your ongoing research agenda.
I know your group research is focused on the interpretation, optimization and application of deep learning algorithms and has a long-term accumulation of video processing applications.
Your paper "Compressed Video Contrastive Learning" has helped me comprehend the content in the compressed video and how it relates to the raw video frames, and has motivated my exploration of utilizing the information in compressed video for super-resolution. The research "Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization" from your group has inspired me to investigate the distribution of features and parameters to understand the form of quantization losses and obtain better quantization performance. My further research will also explore the linkage among compressed video, quantization and video super-resolution.

This is why your lab immediately becomes my target when I decide to apply for Ph.D.

It would be my pleasure to discuss research topics and research plans in detail with you, as well as the value and strength I can bring.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
