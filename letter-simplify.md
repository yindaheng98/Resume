Dear Professor Luo,

My name is Daheng Yin (尹达恒). I'm a 3rd year MSc student majoring in Computer Science at Southeast University. Being desirous of completing more interesting and meaningful work on the interpretation and optimization of deep learning algorithms, I am interested in the Ph.D. program starting in 2023 fall at The University of Hong Kong, particularly the research opportunities in your group.

## My research background

My master's thesis focuses on neural-enhanced live video streaming in the edge computing environment. In this application, the video streaming system should deploy a super-resolution model on a series of distributed low-power computing devices connected by an unstable network and collaboratively produce high-quality video with high throughput (>30FPS) and low end-to-end latency (<500ms). the most challenging but fascinating part when achieving this system is the optimization of the super-resolution model for low-latency distributed inference, and I have gained a great deal from it. It not only prompted me to reflect deeply on the architecture of the super-resolution model but also motivated me to comprehend and implement some of the present quantization techniques such as PTQ/QAT and vector quantization. Besides, the practice also led me to learn the principles of video encoding and become acquainted with the implementation of video codecs, specifically VP9. I believe all of these experiences and skills can benefit my further research in your group.

(The related paper "WAEVSR: Enabling collaborative live video super-resolution in wide-area MEC environment" has been submitted to WWW2023.)

## Why I believe you would be a suitable supervisor

Currently, the neural-enhanced live video streaming system is still bottlenecked by the performance of the model inference latency. None of the typical video super-resolution models (EDVR, TDAN, BasicVSR, etc) cannot achieve the desired latency even with intensive optimization (our methods can only achieve latency <1000ms for the typical model with U-net backbone). To break through this bottleneck, optimization on the super-resolution model is the primary focus of my master's thesis, and will still be the focus of further research.

I believe your expertise in deep learning algorithms will help me excel in this field. and my proposed research also aligns well with your ongoing research agenda. I know your group research is focused on the foundation, optimization and application of deep learning algorithms and has a long-term accumulation of video processing. Your paper "Compressed Video Contrastive Learning" has helped me comprehend the content in the compressed video and how it relates to the raw video frames, and has motivated my exploration of utilizing the information in compressed video for super-resolution. Your research "Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization" has inspired me to investigate the distribution of features and parameters to understand the form of quantization losses and obtain better quantization performance. My further research will also explore the linkage among compressed video, quantization and video super-resolution.

This is why your lab immediately becomes my target when I decide to apply for Ph.D.

It would be my pleasure to discuss research topics with you, as well as the value and strength I can bring. I'm also willing to share my detailed research plan if you are interested.
