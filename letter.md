Dear Professor Ping Luo,

I'm a 3th year MSc student majoring in Computer Science at Southeast University. I am interested in the PhD program at The Univeristy of Hong Kong, particularly the research opportunities in your group.

## My background

My master's thesis focus on distributed accleration of super-resolution inference for live video streaming in edge computing environment. This application scenario requires the video super-resolution network to be capable of performing super-resolution inference in real-time (>30FPS) with low-latency (<500ms) on the support of distributed low-power computing devices, and ensuring smooth playback in the dynamic environment with varying bandwidth between computing devices. To achieve this, I have conducted extensive research on model optimization, including parallel-friendly structure, quantization, feature compression, etc.

## My research interest


Here is my research plan in detail

## Why I believe you would be a suitable supervisor

I know your research is focused on XXX, which are all challenging but attractive. I was impressed by all the work you did. This is why your lab immediately becomes my target when I make the decision to apply for PhD.
