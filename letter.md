Dear Professor Ping Luo,

My name is Daheng Yin (尹达恒). I'm a 3rd year MSc student majoring in Computer Science at Southeast University. I am interested in the Ph.D. program at The University of Hong Kong, particularly the research opportunities in your group. Will you be available to supervise Ph.D. students starting in 2023 fall?

## My research background

My master's thesis focuses on neural-enhanced live video streaming in the edge computing environment. In this application, the video streaming system should deploy a super-resolution model on a series of distributed low-power computing devices and collaboratively produce high-quality video with high throughput (>30FPS) and low end-to-end latency (<200ms). Moreover, the system should ensure the stability of throughput and latency in the dynamic environment with heterogeneous computing devices and fluctuating bandwidth between computing devices.

Realizing this system is challenging but fascinating, and I have gained a great deal from it. First, to improve performance in the dynamic and distributed computing environment, the present model structure for super-resolution must be enhanced, which prompted me to reflect deeply on the architecture of super-resolution model. Secondly, to accelerate model inference and compress intermediate features, I experimented with some the present quantization methods such as PTQ/QAT and vector quantization. The practice has also enabled me to master the use of model optimization tools especially TensorRT. Besides, to investigate the optimization potential in the video codec, I attempted to leverage information in compressed video to reduce computational effort, which led me to learn the principles and become acquainted with the implementation of video codecs, specifically VP9. I believe all of these experiences and skills can benefit my further research in your group.

(The related paper "WAEVSR: Enabling collaborative live video super-resolution in wide-area MEC environment" has been submitted to WWW2023.)

## Why I believe you would be a suitable supervisor

Our neural-enhanced live video streaming system is bottlenecked by the performance of the model inference latency. None of the typical super-resolution models (EDVR, TDAN, BasicVSR, etc) can achieve the desired latency even with intensive optimization. To break through this bottleneck, optimization on super-resolution model is the primary focus of my master's thesis, and will still be the focus of further research.

I believe your expertise in deep learning algorithms will help me excel in this field. and my proposed research also aligns well with your ongoing research agenda. I know your group research is focused on the foundation, optimization and application of deep learning algorithms and has a long-term accumulation of video processing. Your paper "Compressed Video Contrastive Learning" has helped me comprehending the content in the compressed video and how it relates to the raw video frames, and has motivated my exploration on utilizing the information in compressed video for super-resolution. Your paper "Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization" has inspired me to investigate the distribution of features and parameters to understand the form of quantization losses and obtain better quantization performance. My further research on video super-resolution model optimization will also explore the linkage among compressed video, quantization and video super-resolution.

This is why your lab immediately becomes my target when I decide to apply for Ph.D.

It would be my pleasure to discuss research topics with you, as well as the value and strength I can bring. I'm willing to share my detailed research plan if you are interested.
Please find my attached CV or its online version.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
Daheng Yin
