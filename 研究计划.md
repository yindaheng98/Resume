Dear Professor Ping Luo,

I'm a 3th year MSc student majoring in Computer Science at Southeast University. I am interested in the PhD program at The Univeristy of Hong Kong, particularly the research opportunities in your group.

## Research background

During postgraduate, my research topic is to acclerate super-resolution inference for live video streaming in distributed computing environment. This application scenario necessitates that the video super-resolution network be capable of performing super-resolution inference in real-time (>30FPS) with a low-latency (<500ms) on live video with the distributed computing devices, and ensuring smooth playback in the dynamic environment with varying bandwidth between distributed devices. To achieve this, I have used some optimization techniques, including:
1. Modifaction on network structure for parallelism: Split a typical U-net based super-resolution nerwork VRT into independent modules to extract multi-scale information in parallel.
2. Compression of intermediate features for bandwidth saving: Decrease the dimension of intermediate features, quantize features from FLOAT64 to INT8, and compress features with H.264 video encoder.
3. Levarege information in compressed video for smooth playback: Modify VP9 decoder to merge the low-framerate high-resolution video (from super-resolution inference) and high-framerate low-resolution video to produce high-framerate high-resolution video.
4. Dynamic

## Why I believe you would be a suitable supervisor

I know your research is focused on XXX, which are all challenging but attractive. I was impressed by all the work you did. This is why your lab immediately becomes my target when I make the decision to apply for PhD.
