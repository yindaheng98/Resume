Dear Professor Ping Luo,

I'm a 3rd year MSc student majoring in Computer Science at Southeast University. I am interested in the Ph.D. program at The University of Hong Kong, particularly the research opportunities in your group.

## Research background

My master's thesis focuses on the distributed acceleration of super-resolution inference for live video streaming in an edge computing environment. In this application scenario, the video super-resolution neural network should be able of performing inference in real-time (>30FPS) with low latency (<500ms) on the support of distributed low-power computing devices, while ensuring smooth playback in the dynamic environment with varying bandwidth between computing devices. To achieve this, I have utilized various optimization strategies, including:
1. Modification of network structure for better parallelism: Split a typical U-net-based super-resolution network VRT into independent modules to extract multi-scale information in parallel.
2. Compression of intermediate features for bandwidth saving: Reduce the dimension of intermediate features, quantize features from FLOAT64 to INT8, and compress features with H.264 video encoder.
3. Leverage information in compressed video for smooth playback: Modify the VP9 decoder to merge the low-framerate high-resolution video (from super-resolution inference) and high-framerate low-resolution video to produce high-framerate high-resolution video.
4. Variable frame squence length for dynamic bandwidth adaption: Dynamically adjust the sequence length of input frames to balance video quality and latency in dynamic bandwidth.

## Further research plan

## Why I believe you would be a suitable supervisor

I know your research is focused on XXX, which are all challenging but attractive. I was impressed by all the work you did. This is why your lab immediately becomes my target when I make the decision to apply for PhD.
