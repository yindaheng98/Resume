% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\descript{2021.06$\sim$currently}
\vspace{\topsep}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item Derived a parallel-friendly DNN architecture from multi-scale feature extraction structure for better multi-device acceleration in edge environment. % OK
    \item Dimensionally compressed and int8 quantized intermediate features of the DNN and encoded features into video for transmission among multiple devices. % OK
    \item Enhance the video decoder to combine low-framerate high-definition stream and high-framerate low-definition stream into high-framerate high-definition streams for smooth video playback when frame-by-frame super-resolution inference is not supported. % OK
    \item Control the inference process adaptively based on the variable batch size of DNN input and enhanced video decoder to achieve best video quality under a specific latency bound in dynamic edge environments.
    \item Related paper \textit{D. Yin et al., "WAEVSR: Enabling collaborative live video super-resolution in wide-area MEC environment,"} is submitted to WWW 2023
